// Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

// Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

// Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

// Example 1:

// Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
//              Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
